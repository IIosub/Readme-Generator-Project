## README.md GENERATOR

This application simplifies the process for developers to generate README.md files for their projects. It eliminates the need for familiarity with Markdown by prompting users to answer a series of questions in the console, after which the README file is automatically created for immediate use in any GitHub repository.

## Installation Requirements

No direct installation of the app is required. However, users must have Node.js installed on their system to utilize the app's functionalities.

##Â Usage Instructions

- Clone the repository to your local system.
- Run npm install in the project directory to install all required dependencies.
